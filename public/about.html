<h1>About Me</h1>

<p>I'm Omprakash, a passionate learner with a diverse background in product management, data science, 
  AI, and real estate sales. My journey has taken me through hands-on experiences in startups,
   where I've worked on projects in fields as varied as dating applications and real estate, learning 
   the ins and outs of innovation, resilience, and adaptability along the way. With experience in social 
   media marketing and lead generation, I bring a creative approach to sales strategies and customer 
   engagement.</p>
<p>As a Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) practitioner, I’ve developed a unique perspective on human
   behavior and communication, blending these insights into my professional interactions. My drive for
    constant learning is fueled by a vision to help bridge the gap between academic skills and industry
  needs, particularly through educational content that equips students with practical, in-demand skills.</p>
<p></p>Currently, I’m working on building "SparkHike," a startup designed to help students 
and recent graduates navigate career challenges by offering skill-focused education that
 addresses real-world demands. When I'm not working, I'm exploring new tools and techniques
  in AI, data science, and digital marketing or diving into projects that further my commitment to 
  innovation and growth.</p>
